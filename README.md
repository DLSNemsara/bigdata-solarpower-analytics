## Project Overview

This project leverages real-world solar energy and weather sensor data to implement a real-time analytics system. Key features:

- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing** using both **Apache Spark** and **Pandas**
- **Performance Benchmarking** between Pandas vs Spark for big data operations
- **Real-Time Cloud Analytics** using **Snowflake** with Snowpipe, Streams, and Tasks
- **Predictive Modeling** using Spark MLlib (Regression, Classification, Forecasting)
- **Interactive Dashboards** for live data visualization and decision support

## Real-Time Streaming Pipeline

Snowflake was used to simulate a real-time analytics environment with:

- **Snowpipe** for continuous data loading
- **Streams** for change detection
- **Tasks** for scheduled processing
- **Materialized views** for dashboard feeds

## Dataset

We used the [Solar Power Generation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pythonafroz/solar-power-generation-forecast/input) from Kaggle, which includes:

- `Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv`
- `Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv`
- `Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv`
- `Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv`

**Note**: Due to file size and licensing, raw data files are not included in the repository. Sample views are available in the notebooks.
